Hello, welcome to my Demo of band together, I created this to help musicians find other musicians to play with.

--HOME PAGE--

You can login with facebook or create your own account. I recommend creating your own as there's a short walkthrough for first time users. So let's do that.
So here's the short little walthrough on how the app works. See other musicians near you, click like or dislike
, and if you both like each other, it's a match. Now you can chat with that person, maybe set up a time to
get together and play some music. All right, now let's create our profile, it's a pretty quick process.

--CUSTOMIZE--
First we need a stage name, let's go with Peter Parker. Here you can add as much or as little as you like
about yourself.

I was bitten by a radioactive spider, my arachnid abilities give me amazing powers that I use to help others, while my personal life continues to offer plenty of obstacles.

I have this bit here saved so I'll just paste it in here. It's a pretty terrible description for a musician but let's just roll with it. You can add a video of yourself playing, so others can see what you sound like.
I'm just gonna grab this url and put it right here.
Then we have to check off what genres we fit into. I think Peter's more of a Indie/Experimental kind of guy
so let's go with that.
And last, we have to check off what kind of musicians we're looking to play with. Let's just pick a couple of fun ones here and see what we get.
And then once we hit submit, we can see what our profile looks like. Look at that, beautiful.

--DASHBOARD--

Now if we go back home, we can see other people's profiles. This is Jimbo, sounds pretty good. just gonna hit a few likes here. I can click on the profile Icon to see my profile and we can click here to edit it or log out. Now I'm gonna log out of Peter and log in as Jimbo. Then just click like on Peter's profile. And then we can see what happens when Peter and Jimbo are a match. Bingo! Now I can click on the messaging icon and start a conversation with Peter. Let's send him a nice and warm "hello". Then we can log back in as Peter and see that message. Let's just say "hello" back. And a "I really like your music man". And just like that a friendship is born.

And that's BandTogether. Thanks for watching.
